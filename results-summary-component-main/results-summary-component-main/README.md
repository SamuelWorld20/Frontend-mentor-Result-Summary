## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I was able to find out that this html code does'nt actually put the site in actual size according to user's device but I was taught that what it does but with my learnings from this project I think it has a part to play.

And I was also able to find out that this media screen css code won't work if you've done something cotrary in your inline html.

These are the code below:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width:1400px) and (min-width:376px) {
    #second{
        margin: ;
    }.container{
        margin-top: ;
        margin-left: ;
    }
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

Still having problem with media query. Though I tried using it in some of my code but I wasn't able to perfect the mobile view that why I didn't
bother including it. But I want to say it is a very important aspect of coding because most people out there does there things on the phone it's
hard to see someone who wants to check a site then use his laptop.


### Useful resources

- [BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me with the styling. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand media query. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
